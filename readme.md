  <p>
    <strong>Transfer-Hook Program Framework</strong>
  </p>
</div>

Kaptn is a framework for Solana's [Sealevel](https://medium.com/solana-labs/sealevel-parallel-processing-thousands-of-smart-contracts-d814b378192) runtime that makes creating [Transfer-Hook](https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/transfer-hook) programs even easier.

- Convenience macros for abstracting the complexity of native Rust Solana programs
- Similar flow to writing [Anchor](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor) programs
- CLI tool for deploying, managing, and monitoring Transfer-Hook programs (TBA)

This framework is in early development and any contributions or suggestions are very welcome.
